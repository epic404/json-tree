# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Req's
JSON shapes can be irregular and unknown.

We need a custom tree viewer which will take ANY JSON input and build a tree structure using JSX markup.

As a user, I expect to be presented with a text input.

I'll enter a url which returns JSON.

I'll hit submit.

Your app will make a GET request to obtain that JSON... and display it.
